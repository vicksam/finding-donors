# CharityML

In this project I explore supervised learning methods to solve a problem faced by a fictional charity organization, CharityML.
The goal is to find the best model that predicts whether or not an individual's income is more than $50 000 based on census data.

## Dataset

The dataset for the project comes from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). It contains small modifications such as removing missing data or some of the variables.
